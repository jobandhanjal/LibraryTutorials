This repository contains tutorials and hands-on examples focused on Scikit-learn,
a popular Python library for machine learning. As part of my MTech journey in 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, these materials are designed 
to serve as a guide for both foundational understanding and practical 
applications of key ML concepts.

This project aims to:
    - Provide hands-on examples for beginners and intermediate learners in AI/ML.
    - Simplify complex topics with clear code demonstrations and explanations.
    - Serve as a quick reference for MTech students exploring ML concepts.
